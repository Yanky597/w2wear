# w2wear

>W2wear is a website that generates outerwear recommendations base on the weather
>at the users location. I Created the site for a college course focused on front end development.
>The site was built using Html, Css, Javscript, Vue.js & bootstrap.
>>In order to get the weather for the user, I had to first acquire the users coordiantes. 
>>I did that by feeding the users zip code to the google geocoding api.
>>I then used the returned longitude and latitude from the google geocoding api to request the current weather from weather.gov. Once the current weather is returned we can make outerwear recommendations based on the current temperature and conditions. The logic could be found in OuterwearRecommendation.js.

## Artwork
